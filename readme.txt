Increase your WooCommerce Category SEO by adding unique content into your collapsable description. 

== Description ==

Let's you add lots of content in your category description to improve your WooCommerce Category SEO.

Love archive description text for SEO goodness, but don't want it hogging the page. Use this plugin to truncate the category description text and provide a button to expand the text.

Settings include option to choose how to truncate. For instance how many words or how many lines.
